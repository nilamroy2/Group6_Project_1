# Medicare-for-Py
##### Group6_Project_1


Healthcare is one of the top issues up for debate in the 2020 presidential election. The idea of “Medicare-for-all” would bring the US closer to how the rest of the world provides health care to their residents…which has arguably shown to be successful.

We wanted to analyze the current landscape of Medicare in the United States and answer the following questions:

* How have the hospital charges for services for Medicare beneficiaries changed over time?
* Is there a difference in what each state charges Medicare beneficiaries to treat the same diagnosis?
* How much is not getting covered by Medicare?
* What diagnosis are Medicare beneficiaries being seen for the most? Least?
